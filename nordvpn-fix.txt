nordvpnd.service fails to start on linux
SOLVED

This might only be for arch-based distros (Manjaro here). NordVPN Version 3.8.8 from the AUR.

If nordpvnd.service is erroring out, a simple journalctl -xe will give you a clue

nordvpnd.socket: Failed to resolve group nordvpn: No such process

You simply just need to add the group nordvpn and append it to your user account. As root or via sudo just do the following

groupadd nordvpn

usermod -aG nordvpn your_username

Then restart the service.

systemctl restart nordvpnd.service

You'll need to logout and log back in before your user picks up the nordvpn group. You should now be good to go.
